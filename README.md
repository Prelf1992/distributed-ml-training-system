# Distributed ML Training System

A proof-of-concept for a distributed machine learning training system, demonstrating data parallelism and model parallelism across multiple nodes.

## Features

*   **Data Parallelism:** Distribute data across multiple workers for parallel processing.
*   **Model Parallelism:** Split large models across devices or nodes.
*   **Scalable Architecture:** Designed for high-performance computing environments.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Mechanisms for handling node failures during training.

## Technologies Used

*   C++
*   MPI (Message Passing Interface)
*   CUDA
*   PyTorch (C++ Frontend)
*   Kubernetes

## Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Prelf1992/distributed-ml-training-system.git
cd distributed-ml-training-system
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Usage

```cpp
// Example usage (simplified)
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cout << "Starting distributed ML training system..." << std::endl;
    // Placeholder for actual distributed training logic
    return 0;
}
```
